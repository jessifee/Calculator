we need:
- first input number 
    DONE    when a button is clicked the number gets displayed in the lower display 
    DONE    append number when another button clicked
            only start memorizing when an operator button has been clicked 
- memorize operator
             addEventListener that memorizes the operator and the first input number 
- second input number
            when a button is clicked the first number moves to the upper display (incl operator)
            display in lower display
             append number 
- repeat this for every number that is used after an operator has been clicked 
- = button activates calculation
             addEventListener that starts the calculation function 
- calculate 
- return solution to lower display 
- clear
            delete all memorized numbers/inputs
            delete display value 
- delete 
            delete last appended number 



optional:
- add .s 
- add decimal numbers
- round solution ?
